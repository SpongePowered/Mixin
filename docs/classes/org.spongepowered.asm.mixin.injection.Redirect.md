# public interface Redirect Redirect #
>#### Class Overview ####
><p>Specifies that this mixin method should redirect the specified
 method call, field access or object construction (via the <tt>new</tt>
 keyword) to the method decorated with this annotation.</p>
 
 <h4>Method Redirect Mode</h4>
 
 <p>The handler method signature must match the hooked method precisely
 <b>but</b> prepended with an arg of the owning object's type to accept the
 object instance the method was going to be invoked on. For example when
 hooking the following call:</p>
 
 <blockquote><pre>public void baz(int someInt, String someString) {
    int abc = 0;
    int def = 1;
    Foo someObject = new Foo();
  
    // Hooking this method
    boolean xyz = someObject.bar(abc, def);
}</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>The signature of the redirected method should be:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
      <pre>public boolean barProxy(Foo someObject, int abc, int def)</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>For obvious reasons this does not apply for static methods, for static
 methods it is sufficient that the signature simply match the hooked method.
 </p>
 
 <p>It is also possible to capture the arguments of the target method in
 addition to the arguments being passed to the method call (for example in
 the code above this would be the <em>someInt</em> and <em>someString</em>
 arguments) by appending the arguments to the method signature:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
      <pre>public boolean barProxy(Foo someObject, int abc, int def,
    int someInt, String someString)</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <h4>Field Access Redirect Mode</h4>
 
 <p>The handler method signature varies depending on whether the redirector is
 handling a field <b>write</b> (<tt>PUTFIELD</tt>, <tt>PUTSTATIC</tt>) or a
 field <b>read</b> (<tt>GETFIELD</tt>, <tt>GETSTATIC</tt>).</p>
 
 <table width="100%">
   <tr>
     <th width="25%">Operation (OPCODE)</th>
     <th>Handler signature</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Read static field (<tt>GETSTATIC</tt>)</td>
     <td><code>private <b>FieldType</b> getFieldValue()</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Read instance field (<tt>GETFIELD</tt>)</td>
     <td><code>private <b>FieldType</b> getFieldValue(<b>OwnerType</b>
     owner)</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Write static field (<tt>PUTSTATIC</tt>)</td>
     <td><code>private void setFieldValue(<b>FieldType</b> value)</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Write instance field (<tt>PUTFIELD</tt>)</td>
     <td><code>private void setFieldValue(<b>OwnerType</b>
     owner, <b>FieldType</b> value)</code></td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>It is also possible to capture the arguments of the target method in
 addition to the arguments being passed to the method call (for example in
 the code above this would be the <em>someInt</em> and <em>someString</em>
 arguments) by appending the arguments to the method signature.</p>
 
 <h4>Array Element Access Redirect Mode</h4>
 
 <p>For fields of an array type, it is possible to redirect the access to the
 actual array field itself using the behaviour above. However it is also
 possible to redirect access to individual array elements. Consider the
 following example:</p>
 
 <blockquote><pre>private String[] strings = { "foo", "bar", "baz" };

public void print(int index) {
    System.err.println(this.strings[index]);
}</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>It may be desirable to redirect the access to this array element. To do
 so, declare a redirect handler which takes the array and the index (or
 <em>indices</em>, for multi-dimensional arrays) and returns <em>the element
 type</em> (in this case <tt>String</tt>) as follows:</p>
 
 <table width="100%">
   <tr>
     <th width="25%">Operation</th>
     <th>Handler signature</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Read element</td>
     <td><code>private <b>ElementType</b> getElement(<b>ElementType</b>[]
          array, int index)</code></td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
     <td>Write element</td>
     <td><code>private void setElement(<b>ElementType</b>[] array, int index,
          <b>ElementType</b> value)</code></td>
   </tr>
 </table>
 
 <p>The handler receives a reference to the array itself (read from the field)
 and the indices being accessed. See the
 {@link BeforeFieldAccess BeforeFieldAccess args} for details
 on matching array accesses using the <tt>FIELD</tt> injection point.</p>
 
 <h4>Array Length Redirect Mode</h4>
 
 <p>For fields of an array type, it is possible to redirect the call to the
 builtin pseudo-property <tt>length</tt>. To do so, specify the argument
 <tt>array=length</tt> and configure your handler signature to return <tt>int
 </tt> and consume the array as an argument:</p>
 
 <blockquote><code>private int getLength(<b>ElementType</b>[] array)
 </code></blockquote>
 
 <p>For multi-dimensional arrays, provide one <tt>int</tt> argument for each
 additional dimension of the array:</p>
 
 <blockquote><code>// Multidimensional array<br />
 private <b>ElementType</b>[][] array;<br /><br />
 // Handler signature:<br /> 
 private <b>int</b> getLength(<b>ElementType</b>[][] array, int baseDim)
 </code></blockquote>
 
 <h4>Constructor Redirect Mode</h4>
 
 <p>The handler method signature must match the constructor being redirected
 and the return type must match the type of object being constructed. For
 example to redirect the following constructor call:</p>
 
 <blockquote><pre>public void baz(int someInt, String someString) {
    // Hooking this constructor
    Foo someObject = new Foo("bar");
}</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>The signature of the handler method should be:</p>
 
 <blockquote>
      <pre>public Foo constructFoo(String arg1)</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>Note that like other redirectors, it is possible to capture the target
 method's arguments by appending them to the handler method's signature.</p>
 
 <h4>A note on <tt>static</tt> modifiers for handler methods</h4>

 <p>In general, when declaring a redirect handler the <tt>static</tt> modifier
 of the handler method must always match the target method. The exception to
 this rule is application of <tt>&#064;Redirect</tt> to instructions which are
 effectively <b>before</b> the call to <tt>super()</tt> in a constructor.</p>
 
 <p>Consider the following code:</p>
 
 <blockquote><pre>class Foo : Bar {
    Foo(int arg) {
        super(<span style="background: #FF0">Foo.isEven(arg)</span>);
    }
    
    static int isEven(int arg) {
        return arg % 2 == 0;
    }
}</pre>
 </blockquote>
 
 <p>In this example, the inline call to <tt>Foo.isEven</tt> takes place
 <em>before</em> the call to <tt>super()</tt> and (per Java rules) this method
 must be static (because the instance (<tt>this</tt>) is unavailable until the
 initialiser is complete. Thus if you wish to <tt>&#064;Redirect</tt> the call
 to <tt>isEven</tt> then the handler method must also be <tt>static</tt>. The
 injection subsystem will raise an exception for non-static handlers in this
 situation to indicate that the staticness of the handler is incorrect.</p>
## Methods ##
### public String method () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>String representation of one or more
 {@link org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.injection.struct.MemberInfo 
 MemberInfo} which identify the target methods.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;target method(s) for this injector
>
### public Slice slice () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>A {@link Slice} annotation which describes the method bisection used in
 the {@link #at} query for this injector.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slice
>
### public At at () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>An {@link At} annotation which describes the {@link InjectionPoint} in
 the target method. The specified {@link InjectionPoint} <i>must only</i>
 return {@link org.spongepowered.asm.lib.tree.MethodInsnNode} and an
 exception will be thrown if this is not the case.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{@link At} which identifies the target method invocation
>
### public boolean remap () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>By default, the annotation processor will attempt to locate an
 obfuscation mapping for all {@link Redirect} methods since it is
 anticipated that in general the target of a {@link Redirect} annotation
 will be an obfuscated method in the target class. However since it is
 possible to also apply mixins to non-obfuscated targets (or non-
 obfuscated methods in obfuscated targets, such as methods added by Forge)
 it may be necessary to suppress the compiler error which would otherwise
 be generated. Setting this value to <em>false</em> will cause the
 annotation processor to skip this annotation when attempting to build the
 obfuscation table for the mixin.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True to instruct the annotation processor to search for
      obfuscation mappings for this annotation
>
### public int require () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>In general, injectors are intended to "fail soft" in that a failure to
 locate the injection point in the target method is not considered an
 error condition. Another transformer may have changed the method
 structure or any number of reasons may cause an injection to fail. This
 also makes it possible to define several injections to achieve the same
 task given <em>expected</em> mutation of the target class and the
 injectors which fail are simply ignored.
 
 <p>However, this behaviour is not always desirable. For example, if your
 application depends on a particular injection succeeding you may wish to
 detect the injection failure as an error condition. This argument is thus
 provided to allow you to stipulate a <b>minimum</b> number of successful
 injections for this callback handler. If the number of injections
 specified is not achieved then an {@link InjectionError} is thrown at
 application time. Use this option with care.</p>
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum required number of injected callbacks, default specified
      by the containing config
>
### public int expect () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>Like {@link #require()} but only enabled if the
 {@link Option#DEBUG_INJECTORS mixin.debug.countInjections} option is set
 to <tt>true</tt> and defaults to 1. Use this option during debugging to
 perform simple checking of your injectors. Causes the injector to throw
 a {@link InvalidInjectionException} if the expected number of injections
 is not realised.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Minimum number of <em>expected</em> callbacks, default 1
>
### public int allow () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>Injection points are in general expected to match every candidate
 instruction in the target method or slice, except in cases where options
 such as {@link At#ordinal} are specified which naturally limit the number
 of results.
 
 <p>This option allows for sanity-checking to be performed on the results
 of an injection point by specifying a maximum allowed number of matches,
 similar to that afforded by {@link Group#max}. For example if your
 injection is expected to match 4 invocations of a target method, but
 instead matches 5, this can become a detectable tamper condition by
 setting this value to <tt>4</tt>.
 
 <p>Setting any value 1 or greater is allowed. Values less than 1 or less
 than {@link #require} are ignored. {@link #require} supercedes this
 argument such that if <tt>allow</tt> is less than <tt>require</tt> the
 value of <tt>require</tt> is always used.</p>
 
 <p>Note that this option is not a <i>limit</i> on the query behaviour of
 this injection point. It is only a sanity check used to ensure that the
 number of matches is not too high
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maximum allowed number of injections for this
>
### public String constraints () ###
>#### Method Overview ####
>Returns constraints which must be validated for this injector to
 succeed. See {@link Constraint} for details of constraint formats.
>
>**returns**<br />
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constraints for this annotation
