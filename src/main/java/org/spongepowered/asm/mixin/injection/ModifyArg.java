/**
 * Specifies that this mixin method should inject an argument modifier to itself
 * in the target method(s) identified by {@link #method}. This type of injection
 * provides a lightweight mechanism for changing a single argument of a selected
 * method invocation within the target method(s). To affect multiple arguments
 * of an invocation all at once, use {@link ModifyArgs} instead.
 * 
 * <p>Use this injector when a (target) method contains an method invocation
 * (the subject) and you wish to change a single value being <em>passed to</em>
 * that subject method. If you need to alter an argument <em>received by</em> a
 * target method, use {@link ModifyVariable} instead.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Consider the following method:</p>
 * 
 * <blockquote><pre><code>private void targetMethod() {
 *    Entity someEntity = this.obtainEntity();
 *    float x = 1.0F, y = 3.0F, z = 0.1F;
 *    someEntity.<ins>setLocation</ins>(x, <ins>y</ins>, z, true); // subject
 *}</code></pre>
 *</blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>Let us assume that we wish to modify the <ins><tt>y</tt></ins> value when
 * calling the <ins><tt>setLocation</tt></ins> method. We know that the
 * arguments are <tt>float</tt>s and that the <tt>y</tt> value is the <em>second
 * </em> (index = 1) <tt>float</tt> argument. Thus our injector requires the
 * following signature:
 *  
 * <blockquote><code>&#064;ModifyArg(method = "targetMethod", at = &#64;At(value
 * = "INVOKE", target = "<ins>setLocation(FFFZ)V</ins>"), index = 1)<br />
 * private float adjustYCoord(float y) {<br />
 * &nbsp; &nbsp; return y + 64.0F;<br />
 * }</code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>The callback consumes the original value of <tt>y</tt> and returns the
 * adjusted value.</p>
 * 
 * <p><tt>&#064;ModifyArg</tt> can also consume all of the subject method's
 * arguments if required, to provide additional context for the callback. In
 * this case the arguments of the callback should match the target method:</p> 
 *  
 * <blockquote><code>&#064;ModifyArg(method = "targetMethod", at = &#64;At(value
 * = "INVOKE", target = "<ins>setLocation(FFFZ)V</ins>"), index = 1)<br />
 * private float adjustYCoord(float x, float y, float z, boolean interpolate) {
 * <br />&nbsp; &nbsp; return (x == 0 &amp;&amp; y == 0) ? 0 : y;<br />
 * }</code></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p>Note that <tt>&#064;ModifyArg</tt> <em>cannot</em> capture the arguments
 * of the <em>target</em> method like some other injectors can
