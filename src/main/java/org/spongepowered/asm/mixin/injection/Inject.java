/**
 * Specifies that this mixin method should inject a callback (or
 * callback<b>s</b>) to itself in the target method(s) identified by
 * {@link #method}.
 * 
 * <p>Callbacks are simple injectors which simply inject a call to the decorated
 * method (the <em>handler</em>) in the <em>target</em> method (or methods)
 * selected by the selectors specified in {@link #method}. Callback Injectors
 * can also capture arguments and local variables from the <em>target</em> for
 * use in the handler.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Callback handler methods should always return <tt>void</tt> and should
 * have the same <tt>static</tt>-ness as their target (though it is allowable to
 * have a <tt>static</tt> callback injected into an instance method, and for
 * obvious reasons the inverse is not permitted).</p> 
 * 
 * <h3>Basic usage</h3>
 * 
 * <p>The simplest usage of <tt>&#064;Inject</tt> captures no context from the
 * target scope. This is particularly useful if the injector is targetting
 * multiple methods with different signatures. In this case only the 
 * {@link CallbackInfo} (or {@link CallbackInfoReturnable} as appropriate) is
 * required.</p>
 * 
 * <blockquote><tt>private void onSomeEvent(CallbackInfo ci)</tt></blockquote>
 * 
 * <h3>Capture target arguments</h3>
 * 
 * <p>Callbacks can also capture the arguments passed to the target method. To
 * do so specify the target arguments before the {@link CallbackInfo}:</p>
 * 
 * <blockquote><tt>private void onSomeEvent(int arg1, String arg2,
 *      CallbackInfo ci)</tt></blockquote>
 * 
 * <h3>Surrogate methods</h3>
 * 
 * <p>If injecting into multiple methods with different target arguments it is 
 * obviously possible to ignore the target arguments (see "Basic Usage" above)
 * but this may be unsuitable if arguments from the target are required. If you
 * need to inject into multiple methods but also wish to capture method
 * arguments you may provide a <em>surrogate</em> method with the alternative
 * signature. In fact you may provide as many surrogates as required by the
 * injection. Surrogate methods much have the same name as the handler method
 * and must be decorated with {@link Surrogate}. A surrogate may also be
 * required where the LVT of a method with <em>local capture</em> (see below) is
 * known to change between different environments or injection points.</p>
 * 
 * <h3>Capture local variables</h3>
 * 
 * <p>In addition to capturing the target method arguments, it may be desirable
 * to capture locally-scoped variables from the target method at the point of
 * injection. This is usually executed in two stages:</p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Set the {@link #locals()} value of your injection to
 *     {@link LocalCapture#PRINT} and run the application.</li>
 *   <li>When the injector is processed, a listing of the LVT is produced
 *     accompanied by a generated signature for your handler method including
 *     the discovered args. Modify your handler signature accordingly.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>For more details see {@link #locals()}.</p>

     * <p>When capturing local variables in scope, the variables are appended to
     * the callback invocation after the {@link CallbackInfo} argument.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Capturing local variables from the target scope requires careful
     * planning because unlike other aspects of an injection (such as the target
     * method name and signature), the local variable table is <b>not</b> safe
     * from modification by other transformers which may be in use in the
     * production environment. Even other injectors which target the same target
     * method have the ability to modify the local variable table and thus it is
     * in no way safe to assume that local variables in scope at development
     * time will be so in production.</p>
     * 
     * <p>To provide some level of flexibility, especially where changes can be
     * anticipated (for example a well-known mod makes changes which result in a
     * particular structure for the local variable table) it is possible to
     * provide <em>overloads</em> for the handler method which will become
     * surrogate targets for the orphaned injector by annotating them with an
     * {@link Surrogate} annotation.</p>
     * 
     * <p>You can improve the robustness of your local capture injection by only
     * specifying locals up to the last variable you wish to use. For example if
     * the target LVT contains <tt>&lt;int, int, int, float, String&gt;</tt> and
     * you only need the <tt>float</tt> value, you can choose to omit the unused
     * <tt>String</tt> and changes to the LVT beyond that point will not affect
     * your injection.</p>
     * 
     * <p>It is also important to nominate the failure behaviour to follow when
     * local capture fails and so all {@link LocalCapture} behaviours which
     * specify a capture action imply a particular behaviour for handling
     * failure. See the javadoc on the {@link LocalCapture} members for more
     * details.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Determining what local variables are available to you and in what
     * order can be somewhat tricky, and so a simple mechanism for enumerating
     * available locals is provided. By setting <code>locals</code> to
     * {@link LocalCapture#PRINT}, the injector writes the local capture state
     * to STDERR instead of injecting the callback. Using the output thus
     * obtained it is then a straightforward matter of altering the callback
     * method signature to match the signature proposed by the Callback
     * Injector.</p>
