/**
 * A Mixin marked as <b>Pseudo</b> is allowed to target classes which are not
 * available at compile time and may not be available at runtime. This means
 * that certain restrictions apply:
 * 
 * <p>In particular, the superclass requirement for pseudo mixins is extremely
 * important if the target has an obfuscated class in its hierarchy. For example
 * let's assume that we're mixing into a class <tt>SomeCustomScreen</tt> from
 * another party which extends <tt>GuiScreen</tt> which is obfuscated.
 * Attempting to inject into <tt>initGui</tt> will succeed at dev time and fail
 * at production time, because the reference is obfuscated. We can overcome this
 * by ensuring the mixin inherits from the same superclass, thus allowing
 * <tt>initGui</tt> to be resolved in the superclass hierarchy (this is not the
 * case for normal mixins).</p>
 * 
 * <p>{@link Nuke} methods which are <b>not</b> inherited from a superclass
 * (if the target is obfuscated) <b>must</b> be decorated manually with aliases.
