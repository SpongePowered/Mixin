    /**
     * <p>In general, shadow methods can be declared using their name in the
     * target class as you would expect, however we run into a problem when we
     * want to mix in a method with the same name and arguments, but a different
     * return type to the shadow method. While the JVM itself will happily
     * support methods with signatures that differ only on return type, the
     * compiler itself does not. This poses a problem, since we have no way to
     * leverage this behaviour since our mixin class will not compile.</p>
     *
     * <p>To circumvent this compiler limitation, the prefix option can be used.
     * By specifying a prefix for the shadow method, it is subsequently possible
     * to compile the mixin class, the specified prefix will then be stripped
     * from the method name prior to applying the mixin, and everything will
     * work as expected. You may either use the default prefix: "shadow$", or
     * you may specify your own. It is good practice to specify the prefix if
     * you are using it, regardless of whether you use the default or not. For
     * example consider the intrinsic readability of the following snippets</p>:
     *
     * <blockquote><pre>
     *     &#64;Shadow abstract void someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow abstract void shadow$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow(prefix = "shadow$") abstract void shadow$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     *     &#64;Shadow(prefix = "foo$") abstract void foo$someMethod(int arg1, int arg2);
     * </pre></blockquote>
     *
     * <p>All of these declarations are semantically equivalent, however the
     * third and fourth are the most expressive in terms of making their
     * intentions clear, and thus specifying prefix is recommended, since it
     * aids readability and maintainability.</p>
     *
     * <p>Note that specifying a <em>prefix</em> does not <b>enforce</b> use of
     * the prefix, the behaviour of <em>prefix</em> is such that the prefix will
     * be stripped from the start of the method name <em>as long as the method
     * name actually starts with the prefix</em>! This has important
     * repercussions since if the annotation value does not match the method
     * prefix then <em>no renaming will take place</em> likey resulting in a
     * failure state indicated by an {@link InvalidMixinException} at run
     * time.</p>
     * 
     * <p>Prefixes on shadow fields are considered an error condition and don't
     * have any purpose either way, since the scenario described above cannot
     * actually occur with fields.</p> 
     *

     * it may be desirable to suppress the compiler warning which would
