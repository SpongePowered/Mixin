/**
 * This annotation has two uses:
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *     On an {@link Shadow} field, it can be used to raise an error-level log
 *     message if any write occurrences appear in the mixin bytecode. This can
 *     be used in place of declaring the field as actually <tt>final</tt>. This
 *     is required since it is normally desirable to remove the <tt>final</tt>
 *     modifier from shadow fields to avoid unwanted field initialisers. If
 *     {@link Option#DEBUG_VERIFY} is <tt>true</tt>, then an
 *     {@link InvalidMixinException} is thrown.
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     On an {@link Inject injector}, {@link Overwrite overwritten}, or
 *     {@link Redirect redirection} method, it is equivalent to setting the
 *     priority of the containing mixin to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} but
 *     applies only to the annotated method. This allows methods to mark
 *     themselves as effectively final, preventing their replacement by later
 *     mixins with higher priority.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
