/**
 * Defines an <em>invoker method</em> (also known as a <em>proxy method</em> in
 * a mixin, the method. The annotated method must be <tt>abstract</tt> and the
 * signature of the method must match the target method precisely.
 *
 * <p>The target method for an accessor can be specified as part of the
 * decorated method name (eg. <tt>callFoo</tt> to invoke a target method named
 * <tt>foo()</tt>) or specified in the annotation value. Invokers for
 * constructors can be created by specifying <tt>&lt;init&gt;</tt> in the
 * annotation or the fully-qualified class name.</p>
 *
 * <p>Invokers provide a simple way of gaining access to internal class members
 * in a target class without needing to resort to access transformers, and
 * without the usual need to {@link Shadow} a target method. This can both
 * greatly simplify mixins which <b>only</b> contain accessors, and provide for
 * faster development than with access transformers since no re-decompile is
 * needed to put the changes into effect.</p>
 *
 * <p>Invokers can be used in regular mixins as a way to provide access to a
 * private method without needing to shadow and then manually proxy the method
 * call. They can also be used to create <i>"Accessor Mixins"</i> which are
 * special mixins defined as <tt>interface</tt>s which must <b>only</b> contain
 * {@link Accessor} and {@link Invoker} methods. Unlike normal mixins however,
 * <i>Accessor Mixins</i> are accessible via user code and thus no surrogate
 * <i>"Duck"</i> interface is required to expose the generated methods, the
 * mixin itself acts as its own Duck.</p>
 *
 * <ul><li>See also {@link Accessor}</li></ul>
