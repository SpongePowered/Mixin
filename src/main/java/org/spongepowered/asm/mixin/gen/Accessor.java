/**
 * Defines an accessor method in a mixin, the method can be a getter (must
 * return the field type and take no arguments) or a setter (must take an
 * argument of the field type and return void). The annotated method must be
 * <tt>abstract</tt>.
 * 
 * <p>The target field for an accessor can be specified as part of the decorated
 * method name (eg. <tt>setFoo</tt> or <tt>getFoo</tt> to provide accessors for
 * a target field <tt>foo</tt>) or specified in the annotation value.</p>
 *
 * <p>Accessors provide a simple way of gaining access to internal class members
 * in a target class without needing to resort to access transformers, and
 * without the usual need to {@link Shadow} a target field. This can both
 * greatly simplify mixins which <b>only</b> contain accessors, and provide for
 * faster development than with access transformers since no re-decompile is
 * needed to put the changes into effect.</p>
 *
 * <p>Accessors can be used in regular mixins as a convenient way to generate
 * getters and setters. They can also be used to create <i>"Accessor Mixins"</i>
 * which are special mixins defined as <tt>interface</tt>s which must
 * <b>only</b> contain {@link Accessor} and {@link Invoker} methods. Unlike
 * normal mixins however, <i>Accessor Mixins</i> are accessible via user code
 * and thus no surrogate <i>"Duck"</i> interface is required to expose the
 * generated methods, the mixin itself acts as its own Duck.</p>
 *
 * <ul><li>See also {@link Invoker}</li></ul>
