/**
 * This annotation, when applied to a member method or field in a mixin,
 * indicates that the member <b>should never</b> nuke a matching member in
 * the target class. This indicates that the member differs from the normal
 * "overlay-like" behaviour of mixins in general, and should only ever be
 * <em>added</em> to the target. For public fields, the annotation has no
 * effect.
 * 
 * <p>Typical usage of this annotation would be to decorate a utility method in
 * a mixin, or mark an interface-implementing method which must not nuke a
 * target if it exists (consider appropriate use of {@link Intrinsic} in these
 * situations).</p>
 *
 * <p>Because of the mixed usage, this annotation has different implications for
 * methods with differing visibility:</p>
 * 
 * <dl>
 *   <dt>public methods</dt>
 *   <dd>public methods marked with this annotation are <b>discarded</b> if a
 *   matching target exists. Unless {@link #silent} is set to <tt>true</tt>, a
 *   <tt>warning</tt>-level message is generated.</dd>
 *   <dt>private and protected methods</dt>
 *   <dd>non-public methods are <b>renamed</b> if a matching target method is
 *   found, this allows utility methods to be safely assigned meaningful names
 *   in code, but renamed if a conflict occurs when a mixin is applied.</dd>
 * </dl>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 *   <li>To mark all methods in a mixin as unique, apply the annotation to the
 *     mixin itself</li>
 *   <li>Uniqueness can be defined on a per-interface basis by using an
 *     {@link Implements} annotation with <tt>unique</tt> set to <tt>true</tt>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
